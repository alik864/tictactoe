  User Story
  -----------

  When the user logs onto this Tic Tac Toe site they will have the ability to:

  o If the user wants to be "X" they will have to begin first and if the other user that wants to "Y" they will have to begin second.

  o The user will begin selecting an "X" or an "O" and everytime they touch a square it will allow them to change the square to an "X" or "O" depending on whose turn it is.

  o "X" and "O" will take turns marking the squares in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game and will recieve an alert that they won depending on whether they are "X" or "O".

  o Once the game is over and someone has won you will be able to reset the game by pressing the button under the "Tic Tac Toe" headline on the site.
